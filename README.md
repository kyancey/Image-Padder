# Image Padder

This is an Android App that pads any image out to reach any arbitrary aspect ratio. It puts black bars on the side and automatically seeks out the minimum level of padding.

## Support

I do not intend to provide support for this application. I initially started it for another purpose that didn't pan out. If you wish to use it, you may fork it, but you may not use the icon. I don't have the rights to redistribute it outside of my work.
